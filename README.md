## What is it for? ##

Thanks to the Accudemia extensions, now you can integrate your existent applications with Accudemia, allowing users to sign in only once to access all your college sites, or processing the Accudemia information programmatically. For example, you can pull your data to our servers directly from your database or your own system, our you can perform custom formatting and validation to your data just before it's imported.
