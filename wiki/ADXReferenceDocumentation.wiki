= Introduction =

This document describes how ADX works internally and how it is built. Understanding the main concepts of this application is essential to build any kind of plug-ins for the system.

Accudemia Data Exchange is an application part of Accudemia and other Engineerica products that allows users to import and export data from and to multiple systems. It basically can retrieve the information from any source, and export to any other without taking care of where the data comes from.

== How does it work? == 

ADX mainly consists of an engine that performs the following:

  # Retrieve the data from an `IDataSource`
  # Builds a compact database with the information, while removing the duplicates and formatting the data being retrieved (ie, the user IDs might be properly formatted to match the ID mask)
  # Exports the database built to an `IDataDestination`
