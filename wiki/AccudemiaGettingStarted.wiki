#summary Getting started guide to Accudemia development.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

There're also some usage examples so you can get started faster and integrate your applications with Accudemia.

= Before Start: Get your Developer Keys! =

In order to access the service, you need to get your _Developer Keys_ from Accudemia. To do so, sign in to Accudemia and click on _Advanced -> Developers_ on the menu.

On the bottom of the page, a yellow box is displayed where you can get generate your developer keys:

Clicking on the link, will give you a set of keys:

* WARNING: Copy and keep your developer key secure. If the key is stolen, other users can gain access to your information. *


= Examples =

== Single Sign-On - .NET ==

If you have an ASP.NET application, you can integrate both applications.
Please check out [http://code.google.com/p/accudemiaext/source/browse/#svn/trunk/accudemia/IntegrationExamples the example] on our public Subversion code repository. In order to install the example in your site, you need to do the following:

1. On the root of your site, create a page called RedirectAccudemia.aspx, and put the following code:

{{{
<%@ Import Namespace="System.IO"%>
<%@ Import Namespace="System.Net"%>
<%@ Page Language="C#"%>

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
<head>
	<title>Accudemia - Loading...</title>
</head>
<body>

	<%
	// USER CONFIGURATIONS
	const string domain = "yourcollege.accudemia.net";
	const string devKey = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx";
	string userId = System.Threading.Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name;
	

	// Request the login token to the service
	string serviceUrl = string.Format("http://{0}/Services/PublicHttp.ashx?devkey={1}&action=getlogintoken&user={2}", domain, devKey, userId);

	WebRequest req = WebRequest.Create(serviceUrl);

	string loginToken;

	try
	{
		WebResponse response = req.GetResponse();
		using (Stream stream = response.GetResponseStream())
		using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream))
		{
			loginToken = reader.ReadToEnd();
		}
	}
	catch (Exception e)
	{
		// Handle errors, and show a message
		Response.Write("<h2>Unable to access Accudemia.</h2>");
		Response.Write("Please try again in a few minutes or contact your system administrator.<br><br>");
		Response.Write("<b>Error returned by the server:</b><br>");
		
		WebException we = e as WebException;
		using (Stream stream = we.Response.GetResponseStream())
		{
			byte[] buffer = new byte[stream.Length];
			stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);

			Response.OutputStream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
		}
		return;
	}


	// If a login token was obtained, redirect to Accudemia
	const string redirectUrl = "http://{0}/?token={1}&fwd={2}&Referer={3}";

	string forwardUrl = Request.QueryString["fwd"] ?? "";
	if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(forwardUrl))
	{
		forwardUrl = "/Private/Main.aspx";
	}

	string specifiedReferer = Request["Referer"];
	string httpReferer = Request.UrlReferrer != null ? Request.UrlReferrer.OriginalString : null;
	string currentDomain = Request.Url.Scheme + "://" + Request.Url.Authority;
	
	string referer = specifiedReferer ?? httpReferer ?? currentDomain;
	referer = Server.UrlEncode(referer);

	Response.Redirect(string.Format(redirectUrl, domain, loginToken, forwardUrl, referer));

	%>
</body>
</html>

2. You need to configure the page to use your developer keys, where it says:

{{{
const string domain = "yourcollege.accudemia.net";
const string devKey = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx";
string userId = System.Threading.Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name;
}}}

The `domain` is the address you usually use to access Accudemia.

The `devkey` is the developer key you get from Accudemia, as described in the section above.

The `userId` is a bit harder to set up, because it depends on how your application works. You probably are using the .NET Principal class or the Session to store the current logged in user. If Principals are being used, you can leave it as is; if the user information is stored in the Session, your code might look like this:


{{{
string userId = Session["UserId"] as string;
}}}

It all depends on how your application works. If you are not sure about it, please ask your application developer for more help.

3. Open your application source code an add a link wherever you want to the page you have just added. For instance, add this on your site's menu:

{{{
<a href="/RedirectAccudemia.aspx">Access Accudemia</a>
}}}

Also, you can have other links to access specific pages of Accudemia. If you want your users to see a link pointing to _Create New Appointment_, for example, add the following:

{{{
<a href="/RedirectAccudemia.aspx?fwd=/Private/Appointments/OpenSlots.aspx">Create New Appointment in Accudemia</a>
}}}
